## Clock

The Clock module makes working with the [Wakeup] module simpler with its provided time utility functions.

### Clock

`Clock` provides a single module of the same name `Clock`.

````js
var Clock = require('clock');
````

<a id="clock-weekday"></a>
#### Clock.weekday(weekday, hour, minute[, seconds])
[Clock.weekday]: #clock-weekday

Calculates the seconds since the epoch until the next nearest moment of the given weekday and time parameters. `weekday` can either be a string representation of the weekday name such as `sunday`, or the 0-based index number, such as 0 for sunday. `hour` is a number 0-23 with 0-12 indicating the morning or a.m. times. `minute` and `seconds` numbers 0-59. `seconds` is optional.

The weekday is always the next occurrence and is not limited by the current week. For example, if today is Wednesday, and `'tuesday'` is given for `weekday`, the resulting time will be referring to Tuesday of next week at least 5 days from now. Similarly, if today is Wednesday and `'Thursday'` is given, the time will be referring to tomorrow, the Thursday of the same week, between 0 to 2 days from now. This is useful for specifying the time for [Wakeup.schedule].

````js
// Next Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
var nextTime = Clock.weekday('tuesday', 6, 0);
console.log('Seconds until then: ' + (nextTime - Date.now()));

var Wakeup = require('wakeup');

// Schedule a wakeup event.
Wakeup.schedule(
  { time: nextTime },
  function(e) {
    if (e.failed) {
      console.log('Wakeup set failed: ' + e.error);
    } else {
      console.log('Wakeup set! Event ID: ' + e.id);
    }
  }
)
