### window -- browser

A `window` object is provided with a subset of the standard APIs you would find in a normal browser. Its direct usage is discouraged because available functionalities may differ between the iOS and Android runtime environment. 

More specifically:

 - XHR and WebSocket are supported on iOS and Android
 - The `<canvas>` element is not available on iOS
