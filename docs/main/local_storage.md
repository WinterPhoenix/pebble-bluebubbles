### localStorage

`localStorage` is [available for your use](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), but consider using the [Settings] module instead which provides an alternative interface that can save and load JavaScript objects for you.

````js
var Settings = require('settings');

Settings.data('playerInfo', { id: 1, name: 'Scott Wozniak' });
var playerInfo = Settings.data('playerInfo');
console.log("Player's name is " + playerInfo.name);
````
