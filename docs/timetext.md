### TimeText
[TimeText]: #timetext

A [Text] element that displays time formatted text on the screen.

#### Displaying time in a TimeText element

If you want to display the current time or date, use the `TimeText` element with a time formatting string in the `text` property. The time to redraw the time text element will be automatically calculated based on the format string. For example, a `TimeText` element with the format `'%M:%S'` will be redrawn every second because of the seconds format `%S`.

The available formatting options follows the C `strftime()` function:
