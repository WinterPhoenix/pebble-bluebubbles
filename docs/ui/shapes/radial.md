### Radial
[Radial]: #radial

An [Element] that can display as an arc, ring, sector of a circle depending on its properties are set.

[Radial] has these additional properties:

| Name              | Type      | Default   | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ------------      | :-------: | --------- | -------------                                                                                                                           |
| `radius`          | number    | 0         | Radius of the radial starting from its outer edge. A sufficiently large radius results in a sector or circle instead of an arc or ring. |
| `angle`           | number    | 0         | Starting angle in degrees. An arc or sector will be drawn from `angle` to `angle2`.                                                     |
| `angle2`          | number    | 360       | Ending angle in degrees. An ending angle that is 360 beyond the starting angle will result in a ring or circle.                         |
