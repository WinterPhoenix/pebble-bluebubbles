### Card
[Card]: #card

A Card is a type of [Window] that allows you to display a title, a subtitle, an image and a body on the screen of Pebble.

Just like any window, you can initialize a Card by passing an object to the constructor or by calling accessors to change the properties.

````js
var card = new UI.Card({
  title: 'Hello People!'
});
card.body('This is the content of my card!');
````

The properties available on a [Card] are:

| Name         | Type      | Default   | Description                                                                                                                                                          |

A [Card] is also a [Window] and thus also has Window properties.

The `'small'` and `'large`' styles correspond to the system notification styles. `'mono'` sets a monospace font for the body textfield, enabling more complex text UIs or ASCII art. The `'small'` and `'large'` styles were updated to match the Pebble firmware 3.x design during the 3.11 release. In order to use the older 2.x styles, you may specify `'classic-small'` and `'classic-large'`, however it is encouraged to use the newer styles.

Note that all text fields will automatically span multiple lines if needed and that you can use '\n' to insert line breaks.
